User Manual: FixIT Code

This is a user manual for our code as you run it.

This system consists of three Bash scripts:
    •	MAIN.sh: Main script that manages license verification, making the user, and the menu.
    •	Parser.sh: A script that takes names from a webpage and prepares them for account creation.

The purpose of these scripts is to automate user account creation and maintain a record of generated usernames and passwords.

How to run the MAIN.sh script:

    1. On the home page of Ubuntu, open the terminal (ctrl + alt + T)

    2. Move to the directory containing the main script by typing "cd/<directory path>"
    
    3. Verify the file is executable by typing "chmod +x MAIN.sh"

    4. Run the script by typing "./MAIN.sh"

After executing the code and the licence is verified, the User is given
two choices and prompted for an inpout (1 or 2):

(Pressing 1) Automated Account Creation
    •	Takes names from the Tennessee Tech faculty webpage.
    •	Creates accounts for each name found.
    •	Credentials are stored in UserList.txt.

(Pressing 2) Manual Account Creation
    •	Prompts for first and last name.
    •	Creates a single account with generated credentials.
    •	Credentials are stored in UserList.txt.
