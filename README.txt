PROPRIETARY PROPPERTY OF DEELTECH INC, SUBSIDIARY OF GENERAL ELECTRIC

A simple script written in bash to add users to a system.
as of now it does not do anything due to the part that adds users being commented out.

Has the liscencing compiled to further deter piracy.

But come on pirates, if you want a script this simple so bad, just make it yourself, good exercise in bash. Only took me 4 ish hours not counting the liscene not written in BASH
